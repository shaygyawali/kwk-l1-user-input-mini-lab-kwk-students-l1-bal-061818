## User Input Mini App
Now that we know about gets-ing and puts-ing, let's build a simple input/output app. The main objective is to create an application that _takes in user input, does something with that input, and then prints out an output_.

### Gets
The first thing we need to do is take in user input with the `gets` method. Remember, when an executed Ruby program hits the method `gets`, the program is going to pause and wait for the user to enter text into the terminal.

The way `gets` takes in input is important to remember. First, it always takes in input as strings. If a user enters `10`, then `gets` interprets that as `"10"`, *not* as an integer. The second thing to remember is that `gets` also takes in the newline character. When a user types in their input and then hits the `enter` button, `gets` keeps track of the input *plus* the line break. If we were going to NYC, your variable storing the input looks like this:

```ruby
city = "nyc
"
```
See how the string doesn't end after the letter 'c', but actually jumps to the next line? That's the newline character that gets kept track of because of the user pressing the `enter` key after typing `nyc`. We don't want our string to include that newline character, so we have to add the `chomp` method to `gets` to remove that. `chomp` does exactly what it sounds like, it chomps off the return carriage by default. So, we'll use `gets.chomp`.

### The Challenge: A Visit to your hometown
 You're going to build an application to plan a tourist's visit to your hometown. You are going to need to create a new Ruby file by entering `touch trip.rb` into your terminal. Open `trip.rb` with your editor to start writing your program.

You'll want to ask the user where they would like to stay, what sites they want to visit, what food they want to eat, and how many nights they want to stay. For each question, you'll take in input from the user and store each piece in a variable. The tests will guide you through to make sure you've asked the tourist the right questions. <img src="http://new.kudoz.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FullSizeRender-3-300x193.jpg" align="right" width="300" hspace="20">

Once you have that input stored, you'll want to use string methods (like upcase, downcase, captialize, etc) to put the input in a proper format. You can always take a look at the Ruby documentation [here](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/String.html) to learn more about string methods you can use. 

Your final output should use *string interpolation* to output the data in a full summary of their NYC itinerary. 

Remember, you can execute your code by typing `ruby trip.rb` in terminal from inside the directory of this lab. When you're ready to check against the tests, run `learn`.
